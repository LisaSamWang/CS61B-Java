Gitlet Design Document
----------------------

Create different classes for Commits, Stage, and Blobs. Also have a mega class for Gitlet. Main would create Gitlet if
if does not exist yet. Otherwise, it would get the gitlet and work with it, calling the commands.

Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------

Class Gitlet:
-constructor takes in no arguments and calls init if it is not initialized.
-has all the methods.
-creates commits and blobs as needed.

Class Commit:
-stores commits and its information.

Class Blobs:
-stores contents of files as its sha-1 code and the name of the file.

Class Stage:
-helper class that represents the added files that are not yet committed.

Algorithms
----------

Used breadth-first search to do find. Other than that, just java Files and Hashmaps, and some Arraylists as needed.
Classes were the main thing used.
add(filename) takes in the file name and adds it to staging area.
commit(message) takes in the commit message and commits all files in staging area.
rm(filename) just removes the file.

Persistence
-----------

Gitlet is initialized to have a subdirectory called staging that stores added files, another subdir called commits
that stores the commits in the forms of the sha-1 codes, and another remote subdir. The remote subdir is for EC later.
