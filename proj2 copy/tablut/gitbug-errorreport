GITBUG ERROR REPORT

1. Type of operating system you are using to produce this error:
MacPro
IntelliJ.

2. Version of the Java system you are using (java -version).

openjdk version "12.0.2" 2019-07-16

3. Subdirectory of your Git working directory to use as the current
   directory when compiling and running your program.

cd repo/proj2


4. EXACT sequence of commands that will cause the error you are seeing,
   including anything needed to compile and execute the program.
   It is NOT acceptable to say "any execution of the program fails"; give
   us a specific one.

run Main and type in auto black, set maxDepth to 4.

I have looked over the lines and do not understand what could be causing the empty stack. Error does not occur when maxDepth is set to 3 or lower.


5. What you see when you execute the commands in 4.

> auto black
*i4-3
*e6-d
